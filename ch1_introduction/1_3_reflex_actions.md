Q: Are reflex actions (such as flinching from a hot stove) rational? Are they intelligent?

A: The system (human for example) knows that it is touching something hot and knows that touching hot things causes damage to it, so the right thing to do would be stop touching the hot thing- and the system does that, so it is rational. The system applies knowledge that touching hot things leads to damage and that damage is bad by flinching, so it performs better in the environment and so is intelligent.

S: Yes, they are rational, because slower, deliberative actions would tend to result in more
damage to the hand. If “intelligent” means “applying knowledge” or “using thought and
reasoning” then it does not require intelligence to make a reflex action.

Reflection: so intelligence means conscious intelligence and "built-in" recoil from hot things does not need intelligence to work. That goes inline with animals acting on stimulus but not being intelligent.
