## Intelligence

My answer: the ability to gain and use knowledge effectively.

Solution: Dictionary definitions of intelligence talk about “the capacity to acquire and apply knowledge” or “the faculty of thought and reason” or “the ability to comprehend and
profit from experience.” These are all reasonable answers, but if we want something
quantifiable we would use something like **“the ability to apply knowledge in order to
perform better in an environment.”**

## Artificial Intelligence

My answer: a non-human agent's ability to gain and store knowledge, then use it to perform tasks (typically solve intellectual problems) in a way that achieves equivalent results to a human solving an equivalent problem.

Solution: We define artificial intelligence as the study and construction of agent programs that
perform well in a given environment, for a given agent architecture.

## Agent

My answer: something that upon recieving some sort of input, can produce a corresponding output without help from other agents.

Solution: We define an agent as an entity that takes action in response to percepts from an environment.

## Rationality

My answer: logical decisionmaking that is based on the least disputable of available facts.

Solution: We define rationality as the property of a system which does the “right thing” given
what it knows. See Section 2.2 for a more complete discussion. Both describe perfect
rationality, however; see Section 27.3.

## Logical Reasoning

My answer: act of finding useful and true statements from other true statements.

Solution: We define logical reasoning as the a process of deriving new sentences from old, such
that the new sentences are necessarily true if the old ones are true. (Notice that does
not refer to any specific syntax oor formal language, but it does require a well-defined
notion of truth.)
